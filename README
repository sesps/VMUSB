The version of 'vmusbspectcl' that came with the lsu did not have support
for unpacking the the 'marker' module.  This requires creating an unpacker
for it (CMarkerUnpacker.cpp, .h), adding it to the 'stackunpacker' 
(CStackUnpacker.cpp), and modifying the tcl scripts that create the 
treeparameter for it (spectclSetup.tcl) and process the daqconfig.tcl file
(configFile.tcl).

Note!! I've modified this so that it looks for the daqconfig.tcl file
in the spectcl home directory, rather than the 'online' ~/config directory.

This has not been tested... I think that it may be necessary to change
the 'marker' modules default spectrum type (16 bit bitmap)...
